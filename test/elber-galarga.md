## Biography

### Early Years

A descendant of the Greatwyrm that banished demonkind from D'orbiludum eons ago, 
he was born in the north city of Asonyer to a large and powerful Dragonborn clan
known for their extreme approach to the rearing of hatchlings, be summed up as:

"Do all for the weak, but you're on your own".

Finding himself the perfect example of this creed by being the biggest hatchling 
from his batch, he was left to his own devices, having to survive in the notably
harsh northern wasteland. 

### Trials and Tribulations

Growing stronger, he traveled across Baaxal, surviving countless trials, and all
at barely mature age of 12, which is equivalent to late-teens for other humanoid
races. During this time, he rigurously, almost to a religious degree, trained in
all manner of martial weapons and tactics, absorbing the knowledge from the many
"people" he met through out the years.

### Adventuring Days

He became a member of `Table #5`, `Irkstone's` famous/infamous adventurer party.


### Personality

His life goal is to be recognized as a great warrior, and  thus leaving his mark
in history, just as his draconic ancestors. He is is also searching for a method
to become a true dragon.

### Trivia

  master Gorgoroth Rams, a Topaz Dragon, intending to find a correlation between
  draconic cuisineand a dragon's power. While he didn't achive this goal, he did
  end did end up building up the necessary skillset to be a decent cook, and now
  he is able to prepare exquisite dishes, including raw meat dishes. His current
  specialty is grilled meat (K'arn A'zd in draconic).

  taste for music, eventually took up playing the accordion. He then started his
  band `The Dragons of the North`, where he is the accordionist.
