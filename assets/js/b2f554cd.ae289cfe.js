We change our focus to the continent B\xe0axal,\\non the Midwestern town of Irkstone. This quaint mid-sized town is located south\\nof the `Meerqer Mountain Range`, west of the `Ja\'ffay Depths` and just touching\\nthe beginning of the `Lamiscate fields`. It is known to be the \\"starting points\\nof adventurers\\".\\n\\nYou? Well you\'re a no-name/local legend band of adventurers, a party known as\\n`Table \u21165`, and while it\'s not your official name it is related to an infamous\\nevent regarding a table, a **lot of ale**, and the **unrestrained rowdyness** of\\nyour [Dragonborn Fighter](../../../docs/table-5/elber-galarga) and \\n[Half-Elf Ranger](../../../docs/table-5/yaboji). \\n\\nThough you\'re a dime a dozen, you do have a relatively _good-ish_ reputation in\\nthe city of `Irkstone`... _**Somehow**_.\\n\\nYour party, while diverse is known for it\'s lack of humans. You did however have\\na human adventurer by your side, a Wizard named Serolf. And though he was an odd\\nindividual, he did work well with you motley lot, but one day he decided to just\\nretire to study at leisure. Some of you think him dead, others wonder where he \\nreally is.\\n\\nThe party decided to separate for a few months, and meet up at Irkstone at the\\nlocal pub, `Trichotillomaniac\'s Ponytail`, this name is due to the previous owner\\nbeing a pretentious asshole and the current one, `Grog Steingut`, being too lazy\\nto properly do the paperwork required to change the name. In any case, folk just\\ncall it `The Tricky Pony`, which has NOTHING TO DO with the original name.\\n\\nThe Tricky Pony also serves as the unofficial Guild office, since Grog actually\\nis the Guild Master the town\'s branch of the Adventurer\'s Guild.\\n\\nIt is here where our adventure starts."}]}')}}]);
